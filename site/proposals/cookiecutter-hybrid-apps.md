# Cookiecutter Hybrid Apps
An open source framework for hybrid mobile applications.

## Opportunity
We’re constantly doing pitches. A great way to push our pitch over the top is to include a working prototype of what we’re proposing. Making them from scratch is too expensive for most projects. Having a white label project for hybrid apps would allow ustwo to develop prototypes and projects faster and more efficiently. This will become more important the more ventures, partnerships, and startup work we do. ustwo is committed to focusing on these types of projects in 2016. In our 2015 OKRs, we’re looking for open source projects to contribute to. The [`cookiecutter-ionic` project](https://github.com/agconti/cookiecutter-ionic) is an open source framework for building hybrid mobile apps and its adoption will help us achieve these goals. The project is currently looking for community support.

## Hypothesis
The ustwo tech team will benefit by contributing to the [`cookiecutter-hybrid-apps` project](https://github.com/agconti/cookiecutter-ionic) through increased visibility in the open source community and internally by using it for pitch prototypes, ventures, partnerships, and startup work.

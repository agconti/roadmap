# Blog post: "The state of static site testing"

## Opportunity
Currently there is no ( or are very few ) blog posts that discuss testing static sites. Most posts focus on testing web apps. I've already done the bulk of the research and write up in [Research static site testing](https://github.com/ustwo/wear.ustwo.com/issues/38) for the wear.github.io project.

## Hypothesis
Developers would like to read an article that explains how to test static sites.

## Audience

- Web developers everywhere
- Individuals interested in TDD / BDD
- Individuals interested in ustwo’s tech blog

## Value

- Increased ustwo’s presence and visibility within the tech community
- Share knowledge with developers in other studios and beyond
- Give back to the open source community

## Objectives to reach value

- Finish research into static site testing
- Write a simple and effective “How to”.
- Create open source examples to support the article.
- Integrate Disqus to communicate with the community.

## Validation Plan

- Track page hits via Google Analytics
- Gauge the communities reaction via posted comments

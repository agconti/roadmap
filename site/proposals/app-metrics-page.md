# App Metics Page
A dashboard for measuring an an app’s performance compared to its success criteria

## Opportunity
It’s important for projects to have measurable success criteria. Otherwise we would never really know if we’re doing a good job. While we take great care to create meaningful and measurable success metrics, its easy to loose sight of how the current iteration of the project is meeting or missing them. If we had better visibility into our app's performance compared to our success criteria, we’d be able to make better informed decisions about the quality of the implementation or the choice of features.

## Hypothesis
Creating a dashboard for each project that shows how an app is performing with respect its success criteria will allow teams to derive valuable insights about how the app is working. We’ll be able to collect the data we need by using Google Analytics.

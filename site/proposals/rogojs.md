# Rogo.js
An javascript sdk for interacting with Rogo

## Opportunity
With new Rogo rest API, we can retrieve information from Rogo more easily than ever before. Our new OKRs focus on increasing transparency into and spreading knowledge about ustwo’s inner workings. We can achieve those OKRs by creating applications that leverage the new rest API. The studio.ustwo.com project is an example of one of those applications and it needs an sdk like this. Since the Rogo rest api is new, we have yet to set a standard of how client-side applications interact with Rogo.

## Hypothesis
We’ll create many applications that need Rogo’s data in the future. Having a javascript sdk will improve this process.  

## Audience

- ustwo tech team

## Value

- Increased efficiency in consuming Rogo’s data in client-side applications.
- Reduced development time for internal apps that need rogo’s data.
- Keeps our project’s DRY with respect to the ustwo tech team.

## Objectives to reach value

- Build and release a javascript sdk for interacting with Rogo’s rest api

## Validation Plan

- Developers will be able to use Rogo.js easily.
